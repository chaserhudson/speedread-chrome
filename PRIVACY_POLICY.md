# SpeedRead — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 23, 2026

## Overview

SpeedRead is a browser extension that enables RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) speed reading of text you select on web pages. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

SpeedRead does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:

- **No analytics or tracking** — We do not use any analytics services, cookies, or tracking pixels.
- **No network requests** — The extension never sends data to any external server. All processing happens locally in your browser.
- **No personal information** — We do not collect names, email addresses, browsing history, or any other personal information.

## Data Usage

When you select text and activate SpeedRead, the selected text is temporarily stored in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) solely to pass it to the reader window. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is overwritten each time you start a new reading session
- Is stored only in your browser's local extension storage

## Permissions

SpeedRead requests the following browser permissions:

- **activeTab** — To read the text you have selected on the current page when you activate the extension.
- **scripting** — To execute a small script on the active tab that retrieves your text selection.
- **storage** — To temporarily pass selected text to the reader window using local storage.
- **contextMenus** — To add a "Speed Read Selection" option to the right-click context menu.

No permission is used to access data beyond what is necessary to provide the speed reading functionality.

## Third Parties

SpeedRead does not share any data with third parties. There are no third-party scripts, SDKs, or services embedded in the extension.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected here with an updated date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository or contact the developer.
